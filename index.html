			<h2>Create new memories</h2>
			<p>Launched in 2013, here at Scout we offer a hand-picked selection of activities in the UK - especially for you & your little monsters. Our team of explorers have scoured the country to bring you a set of adventures that will leave you with a lifetime of memories. Sign up to receive exclusive discounts.</p>

			<h2>Take the family away for less</h2>

			<p>We offer mountain adventures, fun-filled days out, and city breaks that won’t break your budget. From kayaking in the crystal-blue waters of North Wales to relaxing in the sun, sea and sand in Cornwall- we’ve got all bases covered. In many of our hotels where two adults stay with children, the second child stays for absolutely free.
			</p>

			<p>While we were busy searching for destinations you’ll love, others were noticing the care and attention Scout offers. We were nominated for “upcoming travel company 2013” by Time Out Magazine and our holiday packages hold the top three spots on trip advisors "Best of 2014".</p>

			<p>At Scout we believe in giving back. Once a month we enter all our customers into a holiday prize-draw, with the chance to win a free trip for the whole family!
